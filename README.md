# EmotionDetection_GoogleColab
A simple emotion detection project built in Google Colab using machine learning and NLP techniques.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses a supervised machine learning model to detect emotions from text data. It was developed as part of a data science project using Python, Google Colab, and the Kaggle API.

## 🧠 Key Features
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenizing, etc.)
- Train/test split from Kaggle dataset (not uploaded due to size)
- Model training and evaluation (Logistic Regression / SVM / etc.)
- Simple emotion prediction from text input

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Google Colab
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- Kaggle API

## 📁 Files Included
- `Untitled7.ipynb`: Main notebook for training and testing the emotion detection model
- `Google Colab_CAMendoza.pdf`: Project documentation/report
- `kaggle.json`: API token for accessing Kaggle datasets (⚠️ not recommended to share publicly)

## 📦 Dataset
Used a Kaggle emotion dataset.  
👉 *Note:* Dataset files not included in the repo due to GitHub’s file size limits. You can download them via the notebook using the Kaggle API.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Upload your own `kaggle.json` to your Colab environment.
2. Run the notebook (`Untitled7.ipynb`) on Google Colab.
3. Modify the input text to test emotion predictions.

## 🛡️ Disclaimer
Do **not** upload your real `kaggle.json` or any private API keys publicly. Consider adding it to `.gitignore` and keeping it secure.
